# Laravel News
 Get News API using Laravel as a framework.

Make sure to run Apache, and MySQL servers. I used XAMPP for my project. 
Edit the .env file to connect to the DB.

BE SURE to update the news api key in resources/views/home.blade.php -> [API_KEY]

you can grab the API for free at [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

for the DB, run the following command to generate the DB

```
php artisan migrate
```

To run the program
```
php artisan serve
```

Everytime the app.scss file is edited
```
npm run dev
```
